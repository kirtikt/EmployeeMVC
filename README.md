# EmployeeMVC
Developed an ASP.NET MVC web application for managing employee records with full CRUD operations. Implemented a layered architecture using the Repository Pattern and Dependency Injection. Utilized Entity Framework for database access and Razor views for UI. Incorporated form validation, error handling, and Bootstrap for responsive design.


Technologies Used
Framework: ASP.NET Core MVC (likely .NET 8 based on net8.0 output)

Language: C#

Architecture: MVC (Model-View-Controller)

ORM: Entity Framework Core (indicated by the Migrations folder)

Dependency Injection: Built-in ASP.NET Core DI (evident from Service and Repository folders)

Frontend: Razor Views (from the Views folder)

Configuration: appsettings.json

Static Files: Served via wwwroot
