# EmployeeMVC
Developed an ASP.NET MVC web application for managing employee records with full CRUD operations. Implemented a layered architecture using the Repository Pattern and Dependency Injection. Utilized Entity Framework for database access and Razor views for UI. Incorporated form validation, error handling, and Bootstrap for responsive design.
